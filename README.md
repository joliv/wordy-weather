NWS forecasts for humans.

Bring me online with `docker-compose up`, or `docker-compose up --build` if necessary.

JSON API endpoint is `http://weather.nucleol.us/api/<zip code>`.

For an easily grok-able plain-text view that's good through `curl`, use `http://weather.nucleol.us/curl/<zip code>`.`

Thanks to Jeremy Stanley and his [weather cli](http://fungi.yuggoth.org/weather/) for some database info.
