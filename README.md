=============

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/joliv/wordy-weather.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/joliv/wordy-weather)

NWS forecasts for humans.

Meant to be deployed on [dokku](https://github.com/progrium/dokku).

JSON API endpoint is `http://weather.nucleol.us/api/<zip code>`.

For an easily grok-able plain-text view that's good through `curl`, use `http://weather.nucleol.us/curl/<zip code>`.`

Thanks to Jeremy Stanley and his [weather cli](http://fungi.yuggoth.org/weather/) for some database info.
